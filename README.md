# Romaji Plugin for Micro

**Romaji** is a plugin for the
[micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) text editor that provides a Japanese
input method inspired by the SKK.
It allows typing Japanese Hiragana and Katakana without relying on an external
IME.

See [help/romaji.md](help/romaji.md) for more details.

## Installation

Place the plugin folder in `~/.config/micro/plug/romaji/`, or clone it
directly from the GitHub repository:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/micro/plug
git clone https://github.com/akikareha/micro-romaji-plugin ~/.config/micro/plug/romaji
```

Alternatively, this plugin is also available through the unofficial plugin
channel:  
https://github.com/akikareha/micro-unofficial-plugin-channel  
You can install it by adding the channel and then using `plugin install`.
